# TestGenerator

**TestGenerator** is a WPF-based utility built with **.NET 8** and **C# 12** that scans a given project directory for classes and generates structured test files based on customizable settings. Designed for maintainable and scalable testing, it supports both GUI and planned CLI workflows.
